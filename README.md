# Week 1 Challenge

## Description

This is the landing page for Horiseon. The client requested a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines. I was able to clean up code to have a logical structure. Broken links were fixed and alignment issues were addresed. Alt IDs were also added to all the images and the document has been given a proper title.
